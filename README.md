# deep-learning project
Final project as part of the deep learning course in Bar Ilan.
The project implements neutral networks that works with the Kaggle Chest X-ray Pneumonia Dataset,
which contains 5,863 chest X-ray images of sick and healthy people.
The pneumonia class is combined of two sub-classes, bacterial and viral. 
This project classifies the data into the two main categories and into three categories, using both sub-classes as separate categories. 
It also implements an explainability technique that shows which part of the picture gives us the highest indication of what class it belongs to. 
The methods it uses include transfer learning, anomaly detection, the KNN algorithm, heat maps and more.
More details can be seen in the report file that was submitted with the python notebooks.
